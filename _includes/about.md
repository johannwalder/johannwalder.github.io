<div class="about-content">
My name is Johann Walder. I have been working as a software developer for over {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus:2002  }} years during which time I have collected a lot of different experiences.

This blog is about software development and process improvements. During my career I have been learning a lot from other blog writers and this is my place to give something back to the community. Most of the time, it will be about things I have learnt during my work experience or while working through other technologies in my free-time.
